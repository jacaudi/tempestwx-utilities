// seam so tests can exercise "exactly once" with a fresh sync.OnceFunc

// package-level warnDeprecated below (whose sync.OnceFunc state persists
// across the whole test binary).

// writer and the scrape server are enabled.
//
// It resolves slog.Default() at first-call time (not package-init time) so it
// honors whatever logger main installs via slog.SetDefault, rather than
// capturing the built-in default at package initialization. NOTE: main
// registers the Prometheus writers before it installs the OTel slog bridge, so
// in practice this warning is emitted to the pre-bridge stderr default (visible
// in container logs) and is not routed through the OTel log pipeline — an
// accepted limitation for a transitional deprecation notice on a path slated
// for removal in the next release.
